# 🩺 DiabRisk — Diabetes Risk Screener Platform

**DiabRisk** is an educational web application that estimates the risk of developing **Type 2 Diabetes (T2DM)** using routine, non-invasive health metrics such as age, BMI, blood pressure, and glucose.  
The project demonstrates how interpretable **machine learning** can be integrated into a **cloud-native microservices** architecture.

---
## 🚀 Quick Start (Local Kubernetes)

**Requirements:** Docker, k3d, kubectl

```bash
# Deploy all services (builds images, applies manifests, runs migrations)
./scripts/install-local-k3d.sh
```

Then open **http://localhost** to access the application with Google OAuth authentication.

|------------|-------------|---------|----------|
| **Frontend** | Svelte + Vite | ✅ Deployed | SPA with Google Sign-In, risk assessment form, user profile |
| **API Gateway** | Go (Gin) | ✅ Deployed | Routes requests, authentication middleware, CORS handling |
| **Auth Service** | Go (Gin) | ✅ Deployed | Google OAuth 2.0 flow, session management with secure cookies |
| **Data Service** | Go (Gin) | ✅ Deployed | Database migrations, CRUD operations, PostgreSQL integration |
| **ML Service** | Python (FastAPI) | 🔧 Deployed on server | Risk prediction using trained Random Forest model |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL 16 | ✅ Deployed | User profiles, assessments, sessions, audit logs |

## 🗄️ Database Schema

The PostgreSQL database stores all application data with the following tables:

| Table | Purpose | Key Relationships |
|-------|---------|-------------------|
| **users** | User profiles from Google OAuth | Primary key for auth_sessions, assessments |
| **auth_sessions** | Secure session tokens (SHA-512 hashed) | Foreign key to users |
| **model_versions** | ML model metadata and performance metrics | Referenced by assessments |
| **assessments** | User health data and risk predictions | Foreign keys to users and model_versions |
| **reports** | Generated PDF reports | Foreign key to assessments |
| **audit_logs** | User actions for GDPR compliance | Foreign key to users |

**Why we need the database:**
- Track assessment history over time for each user
- Enable GDPR compliance (data export, right to be forgotten)
- Model versioning and reproducibility
- Secure session management without JWTs
- Audit trail for regulatory requirements

## 🧬 Machine Learning

- **Training data:** BRFSS 2015 — curated diabetes health indicators dataset  
- **Model used:** Random Forest Classifier  
- **Prediction goals:**  
  - Multiclass diabetes status (0 = healthy, 1 = prediabetes, 2 = diabetes)  
  - Estimated risk presented also as a **percentage probability**  
- **Preprocessing:**  
  - Raw features preserved for recommendation logic  
  - Scaled numerical features (BMI, MentHlth, PhysHlth) used for model training   
- **Recommendation engine:**  
  - Generates simple lifestyle-oriented suggestions based on raw patient data  
  - Uses rule-based logic (e.g., high BMI, no physical activity, poor diet)
- **Model training setup:**  
  - Stratified train/test split  
  - Processed datasets stored as CSV (`X_train_processed`, `X_test_processed`, etc.)

Model artifacts and reproducible training scripts are located in `ml/`.

```

**Authentication Flow:**
1. User clicks "Sign in with Google"
2. Redirected to Google OAuth consent screen
3. Callback to `/auth/google/callback` with code
4. Auth service exchanges code for user info
5. Creates/finds user in database
6. Generates secure session token (SHA-512 hash)
7. Sets HttpOnly cookie with domain=localhost
8. User can access protected `/api/risk` endpoint
 └──→ Report Service (PDF generator)
```

Session-based authentication (OAuth / magic link) allows users to view and manage their report history securely.
